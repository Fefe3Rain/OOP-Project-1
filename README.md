Project: Student Record System (with GUI)
Description: Develop a Java Program that manages student information and calculates grades using constructors and method overloading. The system should:
    1. Allow creating student objects with different constructors (default and with parameters).
    2. Use method overloading for calculating grades (e.g., average of 2, 3, or 4 subjects).
    3. Display the complete student information along with computed grades.
    4. Graphical User Interface
